    <html>The <b>JaCoCoverage Plugin</b> is a Netbeans 7.3 plugin that enhances the existing Netbeans functionality with new code coverage features.\

    <br>With code coverage enabled user continues to work with his/her project in the usual way but can easily view the test coverage of the project classes.\
    <br><br>The code coverage plugin will update the code coverage data and refresh editors markup every time a unit test is executed for the project. \
